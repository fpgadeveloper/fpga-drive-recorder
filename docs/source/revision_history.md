# Revision History

## v1.0 (2025.2)

Initial version of the FPGA Drive Recorder, built with Vivado / Vitis 2025.2 and the
Yocto / EDF 2025.2 flow (no PetaLinux flow, no standalone application). First target:
`uzev` (UltraZed-EV Carrier), based on the `uzev` design of
[fpga-drive-aximm-pcie](https://github.com/fpgadeveloper/fpga-drive-aximm-pcie).

* Hardware: `user_data_source` (test pattern generator) and `user_data_sink` (hardware
  checker) insertion points; `fdrec_core` with the ingest FIFO and drop counter, the
  packetizer, the egress FIFO and the AXI-Lite register block (register map 1.1); AXI DMA
  with S2MM (record) and MM2S (playback) in scatter-gather mode; self-checking testbenches
  for the custom RTL.
* Linux: the `fdrec` kernel driver (user-space hugepage buffers pinned by the driver, one
  active + one pending DMA descriptor, `/dev/fdrec0`, sysfs counters), and the `fdrec`,
  `fdplay`, `fdverify`, `fdbench.sh` and `fdsetup-raid0.sh` tools, in the `meta-fdrec`
  Yocto layer; the `dd` speed-test scripts of fpga-drive-aximm-pcie for comparison.
* `fdrec` and `fdplay` default to 32 x 8 MB buffers and stop with a stall watchdog
  (`--timeout`, default 10 s); `fdsetup-raid0.sh --mount` chooses the mount point and
  creates it.
* Second target: `vck190_fmcp1` (VCK190, FMCP1, Versal, PCIe Gen4 x4 per slot), with the same
  recorder datapath.
* Third target: `zcu106_hpc0` (ZCU106, HPC0, Zynq UltraScale+, PCIe Gen3 x4 per slot).
* vck190_fmcp1: PCIe PIPE pipeline 2 stages (timing closure).
* Documentation: this site, with generated block diagrams, the register map, the driver
  and file-format references, and the benchmarks measured on `uzev`.
